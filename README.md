# 🧠 Project NLP | Business Case: Automated Customer Reviews

## 🎯 Project Goal
This project aims to develop a product review system powered by NLP models that aggregate customer feedback from different sources. The key tasks include classifying reviews, clustering product categories, and using generative AI to summarize reviews into recommendation articles.

## ❓ Problem Statement
With thousands of reviews available across multiple platforms, manually analyzing them is inefficient. This project seeks to automate the process using NLP models to extract insights and provide users with valuable product recommendations.

## 📌 Main Tasks

### 1. Review Classification
- **Objective**: Classify customer reviews into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories.
- **Task**: Train a model that classifies review text into one of the three sentiment categories.

**📊 Mapping Star Ratings to Sentiment Classes**
| Star Rating | Sentiment Class |
|-------------|------------------|
| 1 - 2       | Negative         |
| 3           | Neutral          |
| 4 - 5       | Positive         |

**✅ Suggested Pretrained Models**
- `distilbert-base-uncased`
- `bert-base-uncased`
- `roberta-base`
- `nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment`
- `cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment`

**📈 Evaluation Metrics**
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix for class-level insights

### 2. Product Category Clustering
- **Objective**: Simplify and group product categories into 4-6 broader "meta-categories".
- **Task**: Use embedding models (e.g., SentenceTransformers) with HDBSCAN to form clusters.
- **Examples**: Ebook readers, Batteries, Accessories, Non-electronics

### 3. Review Summarization Using Generative AI
- **Objective**: Summarize reviews into blog-style articles recommending top products.
- **Task**: Generate articles for each category including:
  - Top 3 products + key differences
  - Top complaints
  - Worst product + reason

**🤖 Suggested Generative Models**
- T5
- GPT-3
- BART

Fine-tune or use zero-shot/few-shot techniques on Hugging Face models for better results.

## 📊 Datasets
- **Primary**: Amazon Product Reviews
- **Larger**: Amazon Reviews Dataset (multi-category)
- **Additional Sources**: Hugging Face, Kaggle, custom-scraped data

---

## 🌐 Deployment Guidelines
You are expected to deliver an interactive web application. Some ideas:
- A dashboard for the **Marketing team** showing stats + summaries by category.
- A **live review aggregator** with review submission features.
- A **CSV-based review insight generator** (user uploads reviews for automated processing).
- A **search-based product insights tool** (text input → summarized output).

## 📦 Deliverables

### 🧑‍💻 Source Code
- Clean, modular code (Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks)
- Use of functions, `main()`, and structure

### 📖 README
- This file, explaining:
  - Project purpose
  - How to run the code
  - How to reproduce results

### 📄 Final Output
- Blog-style recommendation articles
- A working, deployed web app or dashboard




3. **Deployment**: Use FastAPI .
4. **Documentation**: Prepare README, PDF report, and PPT.
5. **Final Delivery**: Submit code, deployed app, and all required outputs.
